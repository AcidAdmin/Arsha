# Define the stages of the pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# Define a job for the "build" stage
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - # Add commands to build your project here
    - # For example, if you're building a Node.js app:
    - npm install
    - npm run build

# Define a job for the "test" stage
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - # Add commands to run your tests here
    - # For example, if you're running unit tests:
    - npm test

# Define a job for the "deploy" stage
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - # Add commands to deploy your project here
    - # For example, if you're deploying to a web server using SSH:
    - ssh user@your-server 'cd /path/to/your/app && git pull'
    - # You might also restart your web server or perform other deployment tasks here

# You can define environment variables or secrets here if needed
# variables:
#   MY_SECRET_KEY: "your-secret-key"

# You can define specific branches that trigger the pipeline
# by specifying "only" or "except" for each job
# For example, to trigger the pipeline only on the master branch:
# only:
#   - master
